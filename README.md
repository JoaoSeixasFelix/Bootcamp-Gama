## Practical project carried out during the Bootcamp held by Gama Academy, aiming to create an MVP product.

Study application developed to learn technologies and fix web concepts.

## Technologies Used In This Project

- [React](https://www.typescriptlang.org/pt/docs/handbook/react.html)
    - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
    - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/typescript)

## Getting Started

First, before running the development server, we need to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```
Now we need to run the development server:

```bash
yarn run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

  ## React:
    - Here we gained a lot of new knowledge, such as:
    - How to better structure and separate application folders in nextjs
    - How to consume an API using Axios;
    - How to use a token through JWT (Json Web Token) for authentication and social validation.
    - Separation of business rules to be managed by contexts.
    - We learned how to use the data storage structure of cookies, through the use of the nookies 
      library, to store data, if necessary, both on the server side and on the browser.
    - A little more about responsive design and CSS.
